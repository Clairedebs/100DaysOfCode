# Day 43/100

## 🚀 Résumé de la journée
Today was a very short but focused coding session. You dedicated 12 minutes entirely to the `stripe-java` project. The time was evenly split between Java and 'Other' languages, suggesting work on configuration or build files. While brief, it's a testament to maintaining the daily coding habit. Consistency is key, even on days with limited time. This quick check-in keeps the project momentum alive.
