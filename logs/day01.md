# Day 1/100

## 🚀 Resume of the journey
Today's session was a focused 23-minute sprint, demonstrating commitment even on a tight schedule. You split your time effectively between the 'stripe-java' project and maintaining your '100DaysOfCode' log. The work involved both Java and Markdown, showing a blend of core development and documentation. This consistency is key to building lasting habits and successfully completing the challenge.

## Day X: Short and Sweet Progress

Today was a testament to consistency over duration. I managed to squeeze in a 23-minute coding session for my #100DaysOfCode challenge.
